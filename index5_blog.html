            <h2>My FirstDay In The Bootcamp</h2>
            <p>I remember being very excited because I had no idea of programming and wanted to learn a lot to have better job offers.
                It was like chaos ... I had the feeling that my eyes wouldn't stop spinning and I felt like I was going to faint.
                Too much information that also sounded like Chinese. They threw us into the pool with the phrase
                <strong>"you are going to make a web page of your team and do it with google before asking for help"</strong>
                WTF !!!!! I have no idea about anything !!!!
                They were many hours in front of the computer, since in addition, the classes are not face-to-face due to the covid.
                I met new people, I have 2 great teachers and we have a different study method than the conventional one.
                But it was very funny. I really hope I can become a great programmer</p>
