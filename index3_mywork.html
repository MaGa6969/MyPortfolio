<h1>My Work</h1>
<h2>My Portfolio</h2>
<p>This personal page project is my 1st solo project and, it's the result of one of the class assignments.
    It's still difficult to do but, at the same time, it's very exciting to be able to do things without help from anyone
    (except google, of course). The emotions of rage, frustration, anger and stress caused by making this project a
    reality disappear and turn into joy and excitement when one of the things you want to do, works.
    It's very satisfying to see that little by little you are learning things that, just days ago you didn't even know.</p>
